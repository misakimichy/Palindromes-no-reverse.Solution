# Palindromes-no-reverse

#### _C#, .NET: Palindrome Checker, 12/16/2019_
Create a console application that includes a method to identify whether a word is a palindrome. It should return `true` if the user-provided word is a palindrome and `false` if it is not.

A palindrome is any word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same both backward or forward.

## Application should have:
- Separate frontend and backend logic

- Make a console app with a `Check` class.

- Have a method `IsPalindrome()` that checks a string of words and also an integer.

- Check if it's a palindrome or not without using `.Reverse()` method.

## Unit Testing
| User input | Expected output |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Hello World | That is not a palindrome. |
| 1234 | That is not a palindrome. |
| tacocat | That is a palindrome. |
| 1234321 | That is a palindrome. |
| Sore was I ere I saw Eros | That is a palindrome. |
